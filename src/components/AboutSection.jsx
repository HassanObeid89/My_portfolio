          Hi! Iâ€™m Hassan, a junior frontend developer. This is my website, which
          I use to showcase everything I develop. I specialize in React
          development with a minimalist design and attention to detail. Why do I
          need minimalistic design and attention to detail, you might ask? Well,
          scroll down and let me convince you.

        <img
          src={profile}
          alt="A guy with big eyes, short beard and black shirt "
        />
      </div>
    </div>
  );
